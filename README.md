Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Future-Sales-Prediction.git 
Change into the project directory:
   bashCopy code
cd future-sales-prediction 
You are now ready to use the code.

Usage
The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook Future_Sales_Prediction.ipynb that guides you through the entire process. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook:
bashCopy code
jupyter notebook Future_Sales_Prediction.ipynb 
Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the model and make predictions.


Data
This project requires historical sales data as input. The data should be provided as a CSV file containing the following columns:
date: Date of the sale
shop_id: Unique identifier for each shop
item_id: Unique identifier for each item
item_price: Price of the item
item_cnt_day: Number of items sold on a particular day
You can place your data file in the data directory within the project.


Training the Model
In the Jupyter Notebook, there are sections that guide you through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the predictive model.


Making Predictions
After training the model, you can use it to make predictions on future sales. The notebook provides code examples for making predictions on new data.


Example
For a quick start, you can use the example data provided in the data directory. The Jupyter Notebook includes a section with instructions on how to use this example data.
